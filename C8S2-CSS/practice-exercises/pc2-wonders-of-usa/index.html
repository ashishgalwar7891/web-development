                    Opened on May 24. 1883. the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of
                    the East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time
                    of its opening, with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft
                    (38.7 m) above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York
